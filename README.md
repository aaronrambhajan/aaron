Well... This is my personal website. It's an ongoing project, so bear with me.

## Functionality
Right now, it's really just a couple of pretty pages. However, I'm working on building out my portfolio and my blog here. That's coming super, super soon!

## Tools
I'm building it with `React` and `Node`. I'm absolutely in love with the virtual DOM and the class-like feel of `React`.

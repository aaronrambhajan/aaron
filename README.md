# rambhajan.me

Well... This is my personal website. It's an ongoing project, so bear with me.

## Functionality

Right now, it's really just a couple of pretty pages. However, I'm working on building out my portfolio and my blog here. That's coming super, super soon!

## Tools

I'm building it with `React` and `Node`. I'm absolutely in love with the virtual DOM and the class-like feel of `React`.

## Building new versions

This is really just a note for myself to remember that pushing my commits to the repo means that Heroku's going to pick it up for me.

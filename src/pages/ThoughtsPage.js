          There are so many things that I care about and love, and I'm so
          grateful for it all. In the coming months, I really want to focus on a
          few things. Linear algebra, statistics, and harmony are what I'm most
          curious about right now. I'm normally quite overwhelmed with life so I
          don't really know where I'll make time for it, but I know that if I'm
          really interested I will move towards it.

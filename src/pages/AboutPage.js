            Hi! I'm <strong>Aaron</strong>. I'm a music producer turned{' '}
            <u>UX Researcher</u> & <u>Software Engineer</u> passionate about
            understanding how people interact with design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fascinated with <u>building things</u> and understanding{' '}
            <u>why they work</u>
            â€”how and why are my favourite questions to ask, and my experience
            has let me do this.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Background (a.k.a., where the <em>hell</em> did I come from?)
          </h2>
          <p>
            I've explored this as a <u>design entrepreneur</u>,{' '}
            <u>psychology researcher</u>, and <u>software engineer</u>. Each
            experience has taught me invaluable lessons about the impact design
            has on people's lives, and importantly, what my role is in that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Music production is my foundation for understanding technology. My{' '}
            <em>job</em> is to figure out what the artist is trying to
            communicate. It's not just about <em>empathizing</em> with them, I
            have to understand it as <em>they</em> understand it, feel it as
            they feel it. Ask questions about how the world will receive it.
            Leverage deep, wide technical knowledge. Focus on insight in the
            context. Trust the process. It's the kind of job where you have to
            be able to say that you're not right for it: ego is the opposite of
            great production.
          </p>

            I still feel like I'm 4 years old, sitting in my grandmother's
            living room building LEGO. I live to learn, and that I get the
            opportunity to use that learning to make people's lives better is
            the most meaningful, beautiful thing I've ever experienced.
